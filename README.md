# Music Playlist

## Description
This project is a music playlist builder. The underline structure is linked list. This playlist builder allow users to add, remove, search and get the length of the playlist.

## Structure
There are four important files in this project:
- Main:
    - Where the playlist builder resides.
- Playlist:
    - The playlist is in other words the "linked list", where everything related to adding, searching and stuff like removing songs reside.
- Songs:
    - The songs are the "node" of the linked list which contains data and a pointer to the next song.
- Helper Functions:
    - This file just helps clean a little bit the code inside of the other files.

## Stretch Challenge
As a stretch challenge for this project I decided to implement webscraping. To automate creating a playlist form the top 200 songs globaly provided by Spotify.
